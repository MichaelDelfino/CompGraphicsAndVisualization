# How do I approach designing software?
The design process behind this piece of software was first and foremost focused on modularized code. I wanted to design functions that served a wide variety of purposes that I could call within my program rather than to re-use a ton of the same lines of code. Admittedly, I could have done this better given more time, but there are a few aspects of this program in which I accomplished this. My CreateMesh() function took in an identifier parameter that determined what mesh would be generated when the function was called. This way I only used one method rather than many. My Render() function served a similar purpose. Programming it to allow multiple meshes be passed to it meant that I could call the function once and render whichever meshses I wished within it.
# How do I approach developing software?
In developing software I tend to steer toward a more iterative process. By breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks, I find it far less daunting. This leads me to developing portions of the project in a vaccuum, and over time integrating the pieces together to ultimately snowball into the final product. For a 3D project of this type, this meant first developing the primitive meshes of the shapes that my scene is composed of. Next, the meshes were textured to further resemble their real-life counterparts. Finally lighting was implemented to give the scene life. I can't imagine attempting to tackle this sort of project any other way than incrementally in this fashion. 
# How can Computer Science help me in reaching my goals?
With my current job involving manipulating CAD models to create products, this class has shown me a much larger appreciation for not only the ease of using CAD software but the underlying calculations that it performs as well. Each time I change a surface to a model or add elements to it, I can imagine in my mind the vertices and shaders being generated to accomplish the task. I also would like to dabble in game development in the future, so I'm hopeful that having the knowledge from this course will help me along that path as well.
